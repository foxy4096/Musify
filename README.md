Django Project hosted on Python Anywhere
Well recently I was listening some music on Spotify™, And I got an Idea that can I make it ?
So I started writing code and scrolling through stackoverflow(As everyone does 😉).
And actually Now I have hosted this Django Web App on Python Anywhere. link = http://adityapriyadarshi669.pythonanywhere.com/
That's it. Bye for now.
